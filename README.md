Deep Reinforcement Learning for the Exploration of Small Solar System Bodies

This project attempts to use deep reinforcement learning to find optimal orbits around small solar system bodies. Small solar system bodies have irregular gravitational fields that can be difficult to model with conventional techniques. Reinforcement learning bypasses this obstacle by throwing out any dependency on a model of the dynamics. The objective of the agent in this environment is to find an optimal orbit around a small solar system body while staying within a prescribed radius.
